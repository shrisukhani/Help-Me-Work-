# Help-Me-Work-

A simple chrome extension that helps you work by blocking facebook, twitter, etc.

* Help Me Work! is a simple chrome extension I developed to help me work in a focused manner and be more productive.
* If I start a new tab in Chrome and try to open one of the blocked sites, Help Me Work! redirects me to a simple HTML page that reminds me not to waste time on these sites and get back to my work. This page also has a GIPHY of President Trump saying "GET BACK TO WORK OR YOU'RE FIRED!" :)
* It is published on the chrome web store. [__Help Me Work! - Download here__](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/help-me-work/hmjjdchlppicoiimphejlmancijhldmf)
* Blocked sites include:
  * facebook
  * twitter
  * instagram
  * youtube
  * netflix
  * reddit
  * vimeo
  * 9gag
* This list just includes the sites that I and my roommate from last year frequently waste time on and has no logic whatsoever behind it. It was made for my personal use but I published it on the chrome web store with the same list of sites assuming that most people probably waste a lot of time on these sites as well.


## Issues:
* So far there aren't any known Issues. The first version(1.0) of this extension published was not able to block twitter due to a small error in the code, however, this was taken care of. The current version(1.1) blocks twitter as well.
* Please [__download__](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/help-me-work/hmjjdchlppicoiimphejlmancijhldmf) the extension and let me know about any issues you find. Please email me at [shridhar[dot]sukhani[at]yahoo[dot]in](mailto:shridhar.sukhani@yahoo.in).
